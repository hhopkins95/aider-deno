# Plan for Porting aider-py to TypeScript with Deno

## 1. Study the Deno Documentation
- Thoroughly review the documentation in the `deno-docs` folder to understand the latest Deno features and capabilities.
- Pay special attention to areas relevant to the aider-py application, such as:
  - Deno's module system and how to structure a TypeScript project
  - Interacting with the file system and working with paths
  - Making HTTP requests (for web scraping, API calls, etc.)
  - Working with subprocesses and external commands
  - Deno's built-in tooling (e.g., formatter, linter, test runner)
  - Deno's security model and permissions

## 2. Analyze the aider-py Codebase
- Review the `aider-py/aider/` directory to understand the core functionality of the aider-py application.
- Identify the main components and their responsibilities (e.g., coders, prompts, input/output, Git integration, language model integration, utilities).
- Study the existing tests in `aider-py/tests/` to understand the expected behavior and requirements.

## 3. Plan the TypeScript Project Structure
- Decide on the project structure for the TypeScript port, considering Deno's module system and best practices.
- Determine how to organize the codebase into modules or directories based on functionality (e.g., coders, prompts, utilities).
- Plan for any necessary third-party dependencies or libraries (e.g., for Git integration, web scraping, etc.).

## 4. Port Core Components to TypeScript
- Start porting the core components of aider-py to TypeScript, one by one.
- Begin with the most essential components, such as the coders, prompts, and input/output handling.
- Ensure that the TypeScript implementations match the behavior of the Python counterparts by running the existing tests.
- Leverage Deno's built-in tooling for formatting, linting, and testing as you go.

## 5. Integrate with Deno's Features
- Explore how to integrate with Deno's features and replace Python-specific functionality.
- For example, use Deno's built-in file system and path handling instead of Python's `os` and `pathlib` modules.
- Investigate Deno's options for making HTTP requests and working with subprocesses.
- Utilize Deno's security model and permissions as needed.

## 6. Implement Additional Functionality
- Port the remaining components of aider-py to TypeScript, such as Git integration, language model integration, and utilities.
- Implement any additional functionality specific to the TypeScript port, such as a command-line interface (CLI) or a web-based user interface.

## 7. Testing and Debugging
- Continuously run the existing tests from `aider-py/tests/` to ensure the TypeScript implementation matches the expected behavior.
- Write additional tests for any new functionality or edge cases specific to the TypeScript port.
- Leverage Deno's built-in debugging capabilities and any necessary third-party tools for debugging and profiling.

## 8. Documentation and Release
- Document the TypeScript codebase, including any new features, usage instructions, and examples.
- Prepare the project for release, including packaging, distribution, and installation instructions.
- Consider setting up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline for automated testing and releases.
